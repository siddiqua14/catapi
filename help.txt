for windows: 
. Verify the Setup
Restart PowerShell.

Check the values:

powershell
Copy code
echo $env:GOPATH
echo $env:Path
Test bee:

powershell
Copy code
bee version




Run go mod tidy
This command will clean up your module files, adding any missing dependencies and removing unused ones. It will also regenerate the go.sum file to include the correct entries.

Run the following command:

bash
Copy code
go mod tidy
This will automatically resolve any missing dependencies and update your go.sum file with the required entries.

2. Manually Add the Dependency
If go mod tidy doesn't resolve the issue, you can manually fetch the required dependency using:

bash
Copy code
go get github.com/beego/beego/v2@latest
This should add the missing entry to both go.mod and go.sum.

3. Verify Dependencies
After running go mod tidy or go get, verify that the dependencies are correctly installed:

bash
Copy code
go mod verify
This ensures that all required modules are correctly fetched and the go.sum file has the proper entries.

4. Rebuild the Application
Once the dependencies are correctly resolved, you can try running your application again:

bash
Copy code
bee run
